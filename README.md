A custom implementation of key standard C library functions. This library serves as a foundation for subsequent projects by providing a collection of essential functions commonly used in C programming.


## Features

- **Memory Management:** Efficient memory allocation and deallocation functions.
- **String Manipulation:** Custom implementations of standard string-handling functions.
- **Character Handling:** Functions for character classification and conversion.
- **Linked Lists:** A set of functions for creating and manipulating linked lists.
- **Additional Utilities:** Various helper functions for general-purpose use.

## Testing 

1. Place the `test_libft.c` file in the same directory as your header file (`libft.h`) and library (`libft.a`), like [this](https://github.com/alx-sch/42_libft/tree/main/testing_libft).

2. Compile the program using the following command:

    ```bash
    cc -o testing_libft test_libft.c ./libft.a
    ```

3. Execute the compiled program:

    ```bash
    ./testing_libft
    ```
